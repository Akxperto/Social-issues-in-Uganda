</ul>

  <P>First things first, let me briefly restate my sub-issues which lead up to my major issue which is stress; too many school hours per day, fear of failing the board exams and having a very bad educational future and getting a beating from the teachers and my parents or even both.</P><br>

  <p>Now the fact that the exams can not be skipped because they are the ones that will in a way, decide my educational future, we think it would be very good if our parents understood our struggles and instead of beating us because we fail to make up to their expectations, they should support us and the same with the teachers. My coding teacher, Alish told me that they dont beat children in their school because it is illegal to do so and instead of doing that, they are given a detention and three of those lead to being suspended out of the academy for a period of time and three of those lead to being kicked out of the school. we think that this is actually a good system because it doesnt involve physical torture which is no at all good for children.</p><br>

  <p>The final issue that we face is the schooling hours and this is a very big issue because, just as mentioned somewhere before, it gives us very little time to unwind from the daily stress which is more than double due to our class level.We were also told by Alish that they only go to school from 8 in the morning to 4 in the evening and dont even have school during the weekends yet we even have school on sundays for the whole day just excluding the morning and evening preps. the solution to these problems that we think would be very effective is trying to slowly adapt to the school timetable system similar to the Agakhan Academy of Mombasa. Well, we understand that we will not be in this school by the time the school adapts to their system because, in God's will, we will have gone to secondary but it would make life much easier for the oncoming candidates a they will not havwe to go through the stress that we are going thorug right now. </p>
