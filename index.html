<h1>My daily Schedule</h1> <br><br>
<P>In my school, we are always so busy but we normally dont score good grades, at least, mostly we perform very badly and this can be shown by my lifestyle. Our names are Zebosi Helon and Kiberu John and we live in Mbale Tower Primary school in P.7 as a border. this means that we live in the school until there is a holiday. Because we are refered as a candidate class, my daily schedule is very busy and it is as follows;</P>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Time of the day</th>
    <th>Task</th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4:00 am</td>
    <td>At this time we am supposed to wake up and get ready for the day.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4:30-6:00am</td>
    <td>Between this time period, we have morning prep which is a time period where we actually learn our lesons and the day scholars are also supposed to be present.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6:00am-7:00am</td>
    <td>we am meant to get ready for the regular school day during this time but we am usually done with it by 4:30 in the morning so we either sleep if we are very tired or we try to finish my homework.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7:00am-6:00pm</td>
    <td>Between these hours, all the students study and are taught all four lessons, Math, Science, SST (Social Studies) and English. Each lesson is taught twice but differently depending on our timetable </td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
  	<td>6:00pm to 7:00pm</td>
  	<td>in this hour, we are given time to freshen up and relax and if need be, we can do any work.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>7:00-9:00</td>
  	<td>For this time, we also study where we are actually taught things that are part of the unit and the day scholars also have to come</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>10:00</td>
  	<td>at this time, we sleep and it all starts all over again the next day</td>

<p>When we are at home, we are always helping our father in farming potatoes. we have to work very hard for this because if we dont sell enough, we can not have a good meal like chicken and rice for supper. it is a very hard life because there, we have to be awake by 4:30 am and in the farm with my father by 5 am. then, our father goes to the market to sell the potatoes while we stay back taking care of the farm and cattle. we have to graze them regularly. When our father is back, at around 7:00pm, we have supper and either play with each other or sleep.</p>
