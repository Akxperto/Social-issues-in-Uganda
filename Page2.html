  <p> My brother and I have been in this school for about 5 years as we joined in P.1 and the timings were fine as we came back from school at 4 but in P.6 and P.7, life is very hard because we do not want to let our parents down in our first Board Examinations to go to Secondary school called the PLE. this is because in my case, if we fail this, we will be given a beating at home and will be given one last chance if we were to repeat the year and if we also fail, we will have to look for a job and will not be able to continue our education. So, we go through 2 different stresses which is caused by one major stress which is passing my Board Exam. the 2 different stresses are majorly the fact that we will have a very low chance of going on to Secondary School and persuing a good carrier to make my parents proud. The3 other one is the fact that we will be beaten by both my teachers and parents separately. so whatever we do, we have to pass the test</p><br>

  <p>Now that you have the basic knowledge of my normal school day, compared to other schools like my friends' or my coding teacher, Alish Andani, who studies in Aga Khan Academy of Mombasa. this shows that just because where we study is a private school, it is very tiring for us to study approximately 15 hours of school a day, yet according to a research that we did, the average time of studying should be six hours. And now, my issue is evident. TOO MANY SCHOOL HOURS THUS TOO MUCH STRESS! this is also one of my other stresses. working for 5 hours in one day is way too much for a young child like me much as we are soon to be doing my PLE. it gives me such little time to relax and unwind from the hard long day. </p><br>
